This plugin provides a Gutenblock (for WordPress [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg)) for a slider ([Swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/) based).

Please note that this is still alpha!
It is possible to place other blocks into the slider, even nesting the slider and view the resulting slider in frontend.

Some features haven't been implemented yet like slider specific options or a separate slide block (currently commented out).
Any improvements are appreciated! 


Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).
